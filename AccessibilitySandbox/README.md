## Challenges
From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/accessibility-wrap-up):
>1. The check out view in Cupcake Corner uses an image and loading spinner that don’t add anything to the UI, so find a way to make the screenreader not read them out.
>2. Fix the list rows in iExpense so they read out the name and value in one single VoiceOver label, and their type in a hint.
>3. Do a full accessibility review of Moonshot – what changes do you need to make so that it’s fully accessible?
