# Project 14 - Bucket List

This app allows users build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, add a description for that place, look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage for later.

## Topics

Comparable, finding the user’s documents directory, integrating MapKit with SwiftUI, how embed maps into a SwiftUI app, how to use Face ID to unlock your app, how to write data to disk securely, how to enable biometric authentication.

## Challenges
From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/bucket-list-wrap-up):
>1. Allow the user to switch map modes, between the standard mode and hybrid.
>2. Our app silently fails when errors occur during biometric authentication, so add code to show those errors in an alert.
>3. Create another view model, this time for EditView. What you put in the view model is down to you, but I would recommend leaving dismiss and onSave in the view itself – the former uses the environment, which can only be read by the view, and the latter doesn’t really add anything when moved into the model.
