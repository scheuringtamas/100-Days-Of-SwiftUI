# Project 16 - Hot Prospects

This application allows users to efficiently track individuals they meet at conferences or events. It employs QR code technology to store attendee information, enabling seamless exchange of contact details for future follow-ups.

## Topics

Custom environment objects, TabView, Result, image interpolation, context menus, local notifications, Swift package dependencies, swipe actions, SwiftData filtering.

## Challenges
From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/hot-prospects-wrap-up):
>1. Add an icon to the “Everyone” screen showing whether a prospect was contacted or not.
>2. Add an editing screen, so users can adjust the name and email address of someone they scanned previously. (Tip: Use the simple form of NavigationLink rather than navigationDestination(), to avoid your list selection code confusing the navigation link.)
>3. All users to customize the way contacted are sorted – by name or by most recent.
