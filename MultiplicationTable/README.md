# Milestone: Projects 4-6

This is an edutainment app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – “what is 7 x 8?” and so on.

## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/3/3/challenge):
>1. The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…” stepper, going from 2 to 12.
>2. The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, or 20.
>3. You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.
