# Project 19 - SnowSeeker

This app allows users to browse ski resorts worldwide, helping them find the perfect destination for their next holiday.

## Topics

Split view controllers, binding an alert to an optional, using groups for flexible layout.

## Challenges
From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/snowseeker-wrap-up):
>1. Add a photo credit over the ResortView image. The data is already loaded from the JSON for this purpose, so you just need to make it look good in the UI.
>2. Fill in the loading and saving methods for Favorites.
>3. For a real challenge, let the user sort the resorts in ContentView either using the default order, alphabetical order, or country order.
